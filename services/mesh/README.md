# Mesh Network

A high-performance, secure mesh networking system built in Rust designed to enable reliable communication across distributed mesh topologies of up to one million nodes.

## Overview

Mesh is a distributed networking system that provides secure, efficient communication between nodes in a mesh topology. It serves as a communication fabric for complex distributed applications, featuring domain-aware routing, post-quantum cryptography, deliver-once semantics, and comprehensive observability. The system exposes a clean gRPC API for integration with applications written in Go or other languages.

## Architecture

The project is organized as a Rust workspace with the following crates:

### Core Protocol & Transport

- **`mesh-wire`** - Wire protocol framing, encoding/decoding, fast header processing, and message chunking
- **`mesh-session`** - TCP/TLS connection management, handshake protocols, keepalive, and session lifecycle
- **`mesh-storage`** - Write-ahead logging (WAL) and deduplication with pluggable backends (memory, file, Redis)

### Routing & Topology

- **`mesh-routing`** - Domain-aware routing tables, ECMP, and path computation algorithms
- **`mesh-topology`** - Domain graph management and link-state protocols for topology discovery

### Services & Integration

- **`mesh-grpc`** - gRPC services (MeshData, MeshControl) with message tracking, delivery queues, and metrics
- **`mesh-bin`** - Main binary with node bootstrap, configuration management, and system integration

```

## Configuration

The mesh node is configured through command-line arguments. The main binary supports various options for network configuration, TLS settings, and operational parameters.

Example usage:

```bash
# Basic mesh node
cargo run --bin mesh -- --node-id 1001 --listen 0.0.0.0:8080

# With gRPC enabled
cargo run --bin mesh -- --node-id 1001 --listen 0.0.0.0:8080 --enable-grpc --grpc-listen 0.0.0.0:50051

# With TLS and connections to other nodes
cargo run --bin mesh -- --node-id 1001 --listen 0.0.0.0:8080 --tls --connect 192.168.1.100:8080
```

## gRPC API

The mesh node exposes gRPC APIs for data plane operations and control plane management.

### MeshData Service

```proto
service MeshData {
    rpc Send(SendRequest) returns (SendResponse);
    rpc Subscribe(stream SubscribeRequest) returns (stream Received);
    rpc Ack(Ack) returns (.google.protobuf.Empty);
}
```

- **Send**: Applications send messages to destination nodes with routing, WAL persistence, and delivery tracking.
- **Subscribe**: Applications subscribe to receive messages addressed to this node.
- **Ack**: Applications can acknowledge received messages for delivery confirmation.

### MeshControl Service

```proto
service MeshControl {
    rpc PublishState(StateSync) returns (.google.protobuf.Empty);
    rpc GetTopology(GetTopologyRequest) returns (Topology);
    rpc SetPolicy(SetPolicyRequest) returns (.google.protobuf.Empty);
}
```

- **PublishState**: Nodes publish their current state and topology information.
- **GetTopology**: Returns the current network topology view.
- **SetPolicy**: Allows configuration of routing and operational policies.

### Example Go Client

```go
conn, _ := grpc.Dial("127.0.0.1:50051", grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials()))
client := meshpb.NewMeshDataClient(conn)

resp, _ := client.Send(ctx, &meshpb.SendRequest{
    DstNode: 12345,
    Payload: []byte("hello"),
    RequireAck: true,
})
```

## Architecture Details

### Key Components

- **Sessions**: TCP connections with handshake protocols, keepalive mechanisms, and lifecycle management.
- **Wire Protocol**: Efficient framing with 48-byte fixed headers for fast routing and message chunking support.

- **Storage**: Write-ahead logging and deduplication with pluggable backends (memory, file, Redis).
- **gRPC Services**: MeshData and MeshControl services with message tracking and delivery queues.

### Wire Protocol

The mesh uses an efficient wire protocol with:
- 48-byte fixed headers with `srcNode`, `dstNode`, and routing information for fast forwarding
- Length-prefixed framing for reliable message boundaries  
- Message chunking support for large payloads
- CBOR-encoded metadata for extensibility

## Security

## Scalability

The mesh architecture supports scalable network topologies:

- **Domain-Based Organization**: Hierarchical topology management with domain-aware routing
